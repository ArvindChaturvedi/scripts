Good morning everyone,

Today is a bittersweet day for me as I stand here on my last day at this wonderful workplace. It’s a moment to look back and reflect on the incredible journey I've had here and the amazing people who made it truly memorable.

First, I want to say thank you to all of you. Each one of you has contributed to my growth in one way or another. Whether it was through guidance, encouragement, or even just sharing a laugh during a tough day, your support has meant so much to me.

I’ve had the privilege to work alongside some of the most talented, passionate, and hardworking individuals. You all have not only been my colleagues but also my mentors, cheerleaders, and, most importantly, my friends.

But there’s one person I want to take a moment to single out—Shoeb. You’ve been my rock, my constant source of strength and encouragement. Through thick and thin, you were always there. Whether I needed advice, a listening ear, or someone to remind me of my potential, you never hesitated. Words cannot fully express how grateful I am for everything you’ve done for me.

Your unwavering support during my toughest moments and your faith in me when I doubted myself have left an indelible mark on my life. You’ve been more than a colleague—you’ve been a true friend. For that, I will always be grateful.

As I move on to a new chapter in my career, I will carry the lessons I’ve learned here and the memories we’ve created together. I am who I am today because of the experiences and the wonderful people I’ve had the honor to work with, especially you, Shoeb.

This isn’t a goodbye; it’s a heartfelt “see you later.” I hope to stay in touch with all of you, and I’m sure our paths will cross again.

Thank you for making this journey so meaningful. I’ll cherish these moments forever.

Take care, keep inspiring, and keep being amazing!
